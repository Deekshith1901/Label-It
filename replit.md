# LabelIt! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ - Multilingual Image Labeling Platform

## Overview

LabelIt! is a comprehensive multilingual image labeling web application built with Streamlit that enables collaborative image annotation across 13 Indian languages plus English. The platform features geolocation capture, real-time analytics, and professional-grade data visualization for creating labeled datasets for machine learning applications.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web framework with professional custom CSS styling
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application (SPA) with component-based UI
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with wide layout support
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Google Fonts (Inter family) and professional color schemes
- **Performance**: Client-side caching with TTL-based cache invalidation

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency
- **API Layer**: Direct function calls through backend module (no REST API)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized directory structure
- **Session Management**: Streamlit's built-in session state for user preferences
- **Image Processing**: PIL-based compression and optimization pipeline

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: SQLite with optimized pragma settings
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem under `data/` directory
- **Image Storage**: Compressed JPEG format with configurable quality
- **Caching**: Function-level LRU caching with TTL expiration
- **Export Formats**: Excel spreadsheets and ZIP archives for bulk downloads

## Key Components

### Core Modules
1. **app.py**: Main Streamlit application with UI logic and user interactions
2. **backend.py**: Database operations, user management, and data persistence
3. **geolocation.py**: GPS capture with IP-based fallback using multiple services
4. **translations.py**: Multilingual support for 14 languages
5. **utils.py**: Image processing utilities with EXIF handling
6. **styles.py**: Professional UI components and CSS injection
7. **visualization.py**: Plotly-based charts and analytics dashboards

### Database Schema
- **users**: User authentication, preferences, and profile information
- **images**: Image metadata with file paths, categories, and geolocation
- **labels**: User-generated labels with language and timestamp tracking
- **analytics**: Performance metrics and usage statistics

### Authentication System
- Simple username/password authentication stored in SQLite
- Session-based state management through Streamlit
- User preferences including preferred language settings

## Data Flow

### Image Upload Process
1. User uploads image via Streamlit file uploader
2. Image validation and format checking
3. EXIF data processing and automatic rotation
4. Image compression with configurable quality settings
5. File storage to local filesystem with UUID naming
6. Database record creation with metadata

### Labeling Workflow
1. Image display with category selection
2. Multilingual label input in user's preferred language
3. Optional geolocation capture (GPS or IP-based)
4. Database persistence of label with full metadata
5. Real-time statistics update

### Analytics Pipeline
1. Database aggregation queries for statistics
2. Plotly visualization generation
3. Client-side caching for performance optimization
4. Export functionality for data analysis

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for rapid development
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image processing and optimization
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and export functionality
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **Requests**: HTTP client for geolocation services

### Geolocation Services
- **Primary**: ipapi.co (IP-based geolocation)
- **Fallback**: ip-api.com (backup service)
- **Browser GPS**: HTML5 geolocation API integration

### Language Support
- Built-in translation dictionary for 14 languages
- No external translation API dependencies
- Static translation files for consistent performance

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended: Hugging Face Spaces
- **Advantages**: Free hosting, automatic deployment, integrated with ML ecosystem
- **Configuration**: Streamlit SDK with automatic environment detection
- **Storage**: Temporary filesystem suitable for demonstration purposes
- **Limitations**: Non-persistent storage, resource constraints

### Alternative: Local Development
- **Database**: Persistent SQLite with full WAL mode optimization
- **Storage**: Local filesystem with full persistence
- **Performance**: Higher resource limits and better performance
- **Configuration**: Configurable paths and size limits

### Environment Detection
- Automatic detection of deployment environment
- Dynamic configuration based on platform capabilities
- Graceful degradation for resource-constrained environments

### File Structure Optimization
